    bio: " Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student working with Prof. Nitesh Chawla, where my research lies at the intersection of representation learning, missing data, higher-order networks, and uncertainty in machine learning. Iâ€™m passionate about developing robust and expressive models that can navigate the challenges of incomplete data and uncover structure in complex relational systems. Before this, I completed my M.S. in Data Science at George Washington University and earned my B.E. in Computer Science from the College of Engineering, Guindy (Anna University). Looking forward to connectingâ€”nice to e-meet you!",

        "This work presents an end-to-end model for novel view synthesis from a single image, eliminating the need for multi-view inputs or ground-truth 3D data. The model learns 3D-aware features through spatial feature extraction and depth map prediction. A query network generates the target view, while a refinement network inpaints missing regions to produce realistic outputs. The approach is trained and evaluated on the RealEstate10K and KITTI datasets, covering both indoor and outdoor scenes.",
